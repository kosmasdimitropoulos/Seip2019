# Metrics Calculator
Our second assignment is about evaluating a Java application (.jar file) which gets a java (.java) file and a type of Analysis {String or Regex} as an input and calculates some of the java file's metrics such as: Lines of Code, Number of Methods, Number of Classes and produces a .csv file with those three (3) metrics included. The analysis of the file is either being conducted by String or Regex analysis.

3. Change to development branch by typing `git checkout development` in git.
4. Build your project with Maven (In Eclipse go to: --> Run as --> Maven Install).
5. Run the application via command line.
